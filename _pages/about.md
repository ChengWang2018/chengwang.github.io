I am currently a research associate at the [Autonomous Agents Research Group](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk), University of Edinburgh, working with Assoc. Prof. Stefano Albrecht. I obtained my Ph.D. at the [Institute of Automotive Engineering](https://www.fzd.tu-darmstadt.de/fzd/index.en.jsp), Technical University of Darmstadt, supervised by Prof. Hermann Winner. After my Ph.D., I joined DJI Automotive as a senior Engineer, mentored by Assoc. Prof. Yuxin Zhang. 

I will join the Robotics Group (leading by Prof. Yvan Petillot) at the Heriot-Watt University as an assistant professsor on April, 2024. Meantime, I will be affiliated in the [National Robotarium](https://thenationalrobotarium.com) and the [Edinburgh Center for Robotics](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org). I will hire 1~2 Ph.D. candidates after I join. Full funded is possible. Sending me an Email if you are interested in.
