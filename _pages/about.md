I am currently a research associate at the [Autonomous Agents Research Group](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk), University of Edinburgh, working with Assoc. Prof. Stefano Albrecht. I obtained my Ph.D. at the [Institute of Automotive Engineering](https://www.fzd.tu-darmstadt.de/fzd/index.en.jsp), Technical University of Darmstadt, supervised by Prof. Hermann Winner. After my Ph.D., I joined DJI Automotive as a senior Engineer, mentored by Assoc. Prof. Yuxin Zhang. 

I am leading the AutoSafe lab, where the lab's vision is to design and deploy safe and trustworthy robotics to benifit human beings and the society. My research interest is AI safety, driver behavior modeling, safety assurance and motion planning.

I will join the Robotics Group (leading by Prof. Yvan Petillot) at the Heriot-Watt University as an assistant professsor on April, 2024. Meantime, I will be affiliated in the [National Robotarium](https://thenationalrobotarium.com) and the [Edinburgh Center for Robotics](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org). I will hire 1~2 Ph.D. candidates after I join. Full funding is possible. The starting date is expected to be fall 2024. Sending me an Email if you are interested in.
