I am currently an assistant professor at the [Robotics Group](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/engineering-physical-sciences/institutes/sensors-signals-systems/robotics-ocean-systems.htm), Heriot-Watt University, affiliated with the [National Robotarium](https://thenationalrobotarium.com) and the [Edinburgh Center for Robotics](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/about-us). Prior to that, I was a research associate at the [Autonomous Agents Research Group](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk), University of Edinburgh, working with Assoc. Prof. Stefano Albrecht. I obtained my Ph.D. at the [Institute of Automotive Engineering](https://www.fzd.tu-darmstadt.de/fzd/index.en.jsp), Technical University of Darmstadt, supervised by Prof. Hermann Winner. After my Ph.D., I joined DJI Automotive as a senior Engineer, mentored by Assoc. Prof. Yuxin Zhang. 

I am leading the RoboSafe lab, where the lab's vision is to design and deploy safe and trustworthy robotics to benifit human beings and the society. My research interest is AI safety, driver behavior modeling, safety assurance and motion planning.

I am recruiting PhD students and also welcome undergraduate and masters students for internships. Droping me a message if you are interested in.
