I am currently a Postdoc in the [Autonomous Agents Research Group](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My research focuses on explainable AI with a particular emphasis on autonomous vehicles. I was previously a PhD student in [Institute of Automotive Engineering](https://www.fzd.tu-darmstadt.de/fzd/index.en.jsp) at [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/) with the research topic of autonomous vehicle safety. I obtained my Master at Tongji University and Bachelor at the Wuhan University of Technology.
