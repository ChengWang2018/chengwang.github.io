> [IGP2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02277.pdf) generates an optimal plan using MCTS and predictions from goal and trajectory recognition. The internal data structures of IGP2 are
used to build a Bayesian network (BN) model, in which each random variable corresponds to a distinct step during the execution of IGP2. We compare this model to a
contrastive query from the passenger and extract causal info to generate a contrastive explanations.
