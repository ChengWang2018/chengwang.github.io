I am a postgraduate student in Control Science and Engineering at Shanxi University. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from North China Electric Power University (Baoding) in 2021. My research focuses on reinforcement learning, autonomous driving decision-making, and robotic motion and task planning. Currently, I am a visiting student at the RobotSafe Lab, working on inverse reinforcement learning and autonomous driving.
